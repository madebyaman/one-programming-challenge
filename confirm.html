      <p>Awesome you're in. But you need to confirm your email address.</p>
      <p>
        Check your email at the address you joined with. You'll find an email
        from me asking you to click a link to confirm that you want to receive
        weekly issue of Javascript Query.

      <p>Thanks</p>
